# Brain Tumor Classification Project

## Overview

This project takes images of MRI brain scans and using neural networks puts them into 4 different categories judging on the form of tumor present if any. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for the identification of medical tumours. The system is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and uses the design mentioned in the paper below:
